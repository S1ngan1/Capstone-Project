# AI Chatbot OpenAI Quota Error Fix Guide

## Problem
The AI chatbot was showing the error:
```
ERROR GitHub Copilot Farming Agent Error: [Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.]
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced OpenAI Service with Quota Handling
- Created `services/openaiAIService.ts` with robust error handling
- Implements automatic fallback to offline mode when quota is exceeded
- Provides intelligent agricultural advice even without API access
- Auto-resets quota status every 5 minutes to retry connection

### 2. AI Chat Service Wrapper
- Created `services/aiChatService.ts` that manages conversation history
- Integrates farm data context for personalized responses
- Handles multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Copilot) with fallback

### 3. User Interface Component
- Enhanced `components/AISuggestionBox.tsx` with quota status indicators
- Shows clear offline/online status to users
- Provides helpful suggestions even when API is unavailable
- Graceful error handling and user feedback

### 4. Key Features
- **Quota Error Detection**: Automatically detects 429 errors and switches to offline mode
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Provides relevant farming advice based on message content
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time service status with visual indicators
- **Auto-Recovery**: Periodically attempts to reconnect when quota resets
- **Context-Aware**: Uses farm data and sensor readings for personalized advice

## Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
```

### 2. OpenAI API Key Setup
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Add billing information to your OpenAI account
4. Set usage limits to prevent quota exceeded errors

## How the Fix Works

### Offline Mode Responses
When quota is exceeded, the system provides:
- Soil health guidance based on pH and moisture levels
- Water management best practices
- Pest and disease management advice
- General farming tips tailored to user's question

### Error Recovery
- Tracks when quota error occurred
- Waits 5 minutes before retry attempts
- Provides status updates to users
- Maintains conversation history during offline periods

### User Experience
- Clear status indicators (Online/Offline/Quota Exceeded)
- Helpful error messages with actionable advice
- Suggestions continue to work in offline mode
- Seamless transition between online/offline modes

## Usage

### In Your Components
```typescript
import AISuggestionBox from '../components/AISuggestionBox';
import { UserFarmData } from '../services/aiChatService';

// In your component
<AISuggestionBox
  farmData={userFarmData}
  onSuggestionApplied={(suggestion) => {
    // Handle applied suggestions
  }}
/>
```

### Direct Service Usage
```typescript
import AIChatService from '../services/aiChatService';

const chatService = new AIChatService();

// Send message with farm context
const response = await chatService.sendMessage(
  "How can I improve my soil pH?",
  farmData
);

// Check service status
const status = chatService.getServiceStatus();
console.log('AI Online:', status.isOnline);
```

## Benefits
1. **Resilient**: Works even when OpenAI API is unavailable
2. **Educational**: Provides valuable farming knowledge offline
3. **User-Friendly**: Clear status and error communication
4. **Cost-Effective**: Reduces API calls with smart caching
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more AI providers

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Quota Errors
1. Check your OpenAI billing status
2. Verify API key is correctly set in environment variables
3. Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan
4. Monitor usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage

### If Offline Mode Not Working
1. Ensure the service files are properly imported
2. Check console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify the component is receiving farm data correctly

The system now gracefully handles OpenAI quota limitations while providing continuous value to users through intelligent offline responses.
